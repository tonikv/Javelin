# AI Development Notes

## Where AI was used
- Initial project scaffolding and file generation.
- Creating reducer/test boilerplate.
- Drafting i18n key sets and translation placeholders.

## What was decided manually
- Game phase state machine boundaries.
- Throw tuning constants and scoring model.
- Accessibility requirements and keyboard control behavior.
- Separation between domain logic, render logic, and React UI.

## Suggestions rejected
- Overly realistic aerodynamic simulation (too much scope for MVP).
- Asset-heavy sprite pipeline (kept code-drawn canvas graphics).

## Quality checks
- Unit tests for scoring, reducer transitions, and highscore helpers.
- TypeScript strict compilation.
- Production build verification with Vite.
